Welcome to Spring Rest Framework documentation!
===================================

**Spring REST Framework (SRF)** is a powerful library for Spring applications that brings the simplicity and flexibility of Django's REST Framework to Spring.
SRF streamlines API development with powerful serialization, flexible filters, and seamless integration.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`Usage` section for further information, including
